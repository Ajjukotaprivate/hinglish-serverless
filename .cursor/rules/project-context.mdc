# Project Context
You are helping me build a SaaS similar to SubtitlesFast for Indian creators. 
Below is the full project description:|

I am building a SaaS exactly like SubtitlesFast for Indian creators.
Users upload a video → I extract audio with FFmpeg → send to my RunPod serverless Whisper-Hindi2Hinglish-Apex ASR model → receive Hinglish transcription with timestamps → generate SRT → show a timeline subtitle editor → allow viral TikTok-style caption styling → paywall export → burn subtitles into video using FFmpeg → return final MP4.

Backend stack: Supabase Storage + Supabase Edge Functions + RunPod Serverless GPU.
Frontend stack: Next.js + video player + timeline editor + SRT editor.
Whisper model is deployed as custom Docker on RunPod.
Editorial features identical to SubtitlesFast UI.
Payment is credit-based.
Worker warm-up is done using dummy audio to reduce cold starts.
The entire pipeline must maintain perfect A/V sync.
